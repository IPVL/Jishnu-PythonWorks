# Jishnu-PythonWorks

---Chapter 1---

@can mod after decimal points
@can handle big numbers like 100/200 digits
@can handle imaginary numbers

---Chapter 2---

@Lists can be modified by using addition and multiplication operations
@strings can be sliced and concatenated
@lists can be used like loops
@membership can be tasted
@append pushes one attribute to the last
@extend adds another list and merges it into one
@count/min/max functions are used
@can pop any element from any position
@can remove an element from a list
@can be sorted according to coder's wish(most of the time)

---Chapter 3---

@there are two unnecessary string operations -> replacement and substitution
@Field width can be defined for numbers and strings
@a substring can be found in a string and within defined portion
@a string can be replaced/lowercased/uppercased/titled
@a string can be splitted by any character

---Chapter 4---

@copy function makes an changable copy
@deepcopy makes an unchangable copy
@items can be added or removed
@if anything is not defined, one/more default attribute can be set
@a list can be updated by an att or a set of att
@there's a function has_key to check if the key is present in the list (not that necessary)

---Chapter 5---

x,y,z = 1,2,3
print y
x,z=y,x
print x,y,z
x,y,z=1,2,3
z,x=x,y
print x,y,z

Out puts ->
2
2 2 1
2 2 1

(this is quite peculiar comparing with C/C++)

@string can be edited using +/*
@append is used to check the validity of a logical operation
@an att can be checked whether it is within the range (A,B)
@a substring can be checked whether it is present in another string
@range function is used to list numbers within the range
@zip function can be used to list corresponding data
